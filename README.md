## Description
Mobile Application User Behavior Analysis" project
In this project, we will investigate the user behavior of the mobile application of a startup specializing in food sales. Our goal is to analyze the sales funnel to identify key stages of the buying process and identify possible problematic points where users get "stuck". In addition, we will study the results of an A/A/B experiment aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of an app design change.

Project Goal: To study the sales funnel and identify the stages where the most users are lost. Analyze the results of the A/A/B experiment to determine the impact of a design change on user behavior. Make an informed decision regarding the effectiveness of a design change based on statistical data.

## Conclusion
In this study, we examined the behavior of mobile app users based on logs and analyzed the results of the A/A/B test. After pre-processing the data, we examined the actions of 7419 users of the app.

We identified the following:

7,419 users (100% of the total) visited the main page of the app. 4593 users (61.9% of the total number) viewed the product page. 3,734 users (50.3% of the total) went to the cart page. 3,539 users (47.7% of the total) completed the payment. The "Tutorial" event was excluded from the analysis due to its optional nature and lack of influence on the next steps. We lost the largest number of users after the first step (over 38%), further losses amounted to less than 9% in the second step and about 2% in the last step. Thus, about 48% of users successfully completed the payment.

We then analyzed the results of the A/A/B test, which involved changing the fonts in the application. We examined the behavior of users divided into three groups: 246th, 247th, and 248th. Multiple A/B tests conducted for each event revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups. Thus, changing the fonts throughout the application had no effect on user behavior.
