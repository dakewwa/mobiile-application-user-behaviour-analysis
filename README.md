Mobile Application User Behavior Analysis" project
In this project, we will investigate the user behavior of the mobile application of a startup specializing in food sales. Our goal is to analyze the sales funnel to identify key stages of the buying process and identify possible problematic points where users get "stuck". In addition, we will study the results of an A/A/B experiment aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of an app design change.

Project Goal: To study the sales funnel and identify the stages where the most users are lost. Analyze the results of the A/A/B experiment to determine the impact of a design change on user behavior. Make an informed decision regarding the effectiveness of a design change based on statistical data.

Conclusion
In this study, we examined the user behavior of the mobile application based on logs and analyzed the results of the A/A/B test. After pre-processing the data, we examined the actions of 7419 users of the app.
